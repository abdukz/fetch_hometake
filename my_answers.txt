How would you deploy this application in production?Containerize it using Docker, and then manage deployment and scalability by running Docker containers in a k8s.What other components would you want to add to make this production-ready?To make this application production-ready, it should include error handling, logging, monitoring with alerts, automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, and leverage AWS CloudWatch for scaling, etc.How can this application scale with a growing dataset?Real-time services like AWS Kinesis or Kafka can be used for data ingestion and streaming, while leveraging replication and sharding techniques for database scalability in the data warehouse. Additionally, implementing caching mechanisms can help improve read performance.How can PII be recovered later on?To handle PII , extra columns can be created for the ‘ip’ and ‘device_id’ columns  in the database table. Proper access controls should be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only.
